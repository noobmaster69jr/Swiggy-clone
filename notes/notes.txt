Is jsx mandatory for react?
	JSX is not a requirement for using React. Using React without JSX is especially convenient when you don't want to set up compilation in your build environment. Each JSX element is just syntactic sugar for calling React.

Is ES6 mandatory for React?
	No it is not, but is highly recommmendable as many latest project created on react rely a lot on ES6

How can I write comments in JSX?
	we can use write comments inside of {}, as react reads curly braces as javascript

What is React Fragment? ​
	 React Fragment is a feature in React that allows you to return multiple elements from a React component by allowing you to group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM. 
	 <></> shorthand  for writing React.Fragment

what is virtual DOM?
	The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called reconciliation.

Why we need keys in React? When do we need keys in React?
	A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements in React.
 Keys are used in React to identify which items in the list are changed, updated, or deleted.
 In other words, we can say that keys are used to give an identity to the elements in the lists

Can we use index as keys in React?
	We don't recommend using indexes for keys if the order of items may change.
 This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state.

Config driven UI
	 CDD is a way of using modularity to build a loosely coupled set of components that are then composed together using a common interface.

*Every component in react has some state, every time we want to use some local variable in react 
we use state

*Hook is just a normal function
*useState() to create local state variable

const [varName, setvarName] = useState("defaultValue");
using setvarName we can change value of varName

when we want to keep variable in sync with the ui we use state variable, it will automatically
rerender

Config.js allows developers to configure their applications in an XML block instead of hard-coding values inside their scripts or in JSON objects. 
 The XML can be embedded inside an HTML document or in a separate XML file. 
 The configuration block may contain strings, numbers, arrays and HTML.

 whenever the state variable is changed the whole component is rerendered

 in react we load -> render -> call api -> update ui [useEffect hook is used for this]

 useEffect(callback, dependencies array) 
 useEffect(()=>{

 }, []) - callback is dependent on the dependencies array, and runs once initially and runs
  only if it changes
 if the dependencies array is empty it will be called only once
 if we don't pass anything after callback useEffect will be called after every render

 conditional rendering:
 if restaurant is empty load - shimmer ui
 else load - actual ui


 diff algorithm is the core of react

 react says that never create a component inside a component
 never write a useState insde a if, else or for it leads to inconsistencies

 always create state variables inside function component

 use "formik" package to create form

 import {createBrowserRouter, RouterProvider, Outlet } from "react-router-dom" -> helps us create a router

 SPA - single page application
 2 types of routing :
 		 1.server side routing - all our pages comes from server
		 2.client side routing - we are only loading another component, not making network call

to use anchor element inside react we use "Link"

all the children will go inside the Outlet according to the route
